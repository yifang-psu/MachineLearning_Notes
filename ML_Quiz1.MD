### Machine Learning Quiz 1:

#### Clustering, Classification, Naive Bayes

1. High entropy means that the partitions in classification are: <br/>
[a] not pure <br/>
[b] pure <br/>
[c] useful <br/>
[d] useless <br/>

    Answer: [a]. Entropy is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw any conclusions from that  information. It is a measure of disorder or purity or unpredictability or uncertainty. Low entropy means less uncertain and high entropy means more uncertain.
