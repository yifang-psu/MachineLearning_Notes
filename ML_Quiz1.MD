### Machine Learning Quiz 1:

#### Clustering, Classification, Naive Bayes

1. High entropy means that the partitions in classification are: <br/>
[a] not pure <br/>
[b] pure <br/>
[c] useful <br/>
[d] useless <br/>

    Answer: [a]. Entropy is a measure of the randomness in the information being processed. The higher the entropy, the harder it is to draw any conclusions from that  information. It is a measure of disorder or purity or unpredictability or uncertainty. Low entropy means less uncertain and high entropy means more uncertain.

2. A machine learning problem involves four attributes plus a class. The attributes have 3, 3, 4, and 6 possible values each. The class has 3 possible values. How many maximum possible different examples are there? <br/>
[a] 9 <br/>
[b] 16 <br/>
[c] 144 <br/>
[d] 216 <br/>

    Answer: [d]. Maximum possible different examples are the products of the possible values of each attribute and the number of classes: $3 * 3 * 4 * 6 = 72$ .
